# Connect-JRC-IoT

This project is amied to develop a web application on which a microcontroller based device can be controlled.

## How it works

Suppose, you have an LED attached with the microcontroller at pin 14. You will get a switch in our application by which you can control your LED.
Our application also has different kind of controllers to control inputs/outputs like regulator, display etc.

### The project is under development. Once completed the usable version will be hosted.
